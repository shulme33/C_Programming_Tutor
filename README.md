This repo contains a list of C programming projects that were written as part of the CSCI 145 class at MSU, of which I was a tutor. These are my versions of programs that students were tasked with writing as part of the course.

To run, install the gcc compiler. Then compile with:

### `$ gcc [programName].c -o programName`

Then run the program with:

### `$ ./programName`

For example, if compiling a file called _hulme_samuel_lab0.c_, run the following commands:

### `$ gcc hulme_samuel_lab0.c -o hulme_samuel_lab0`

### `$ ./hulme_samuel_lab0`
